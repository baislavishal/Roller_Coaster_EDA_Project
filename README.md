ðŸŽ¢ Roller Coaster Data Analysis (EDA)
This project dives into an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of roller coaster data, uncovering fascinating insights and trends about some of the most thrilling rides around the world. Through Python and visualization libraries, we analyze the factors that make roller coasters exciting and impactful.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Objective: To explore and analyze roller coaster data, uncover patterns, and present insights in a visually engaging manner.

Focus Areas:
Analyzing speed, height, and thrill factors of roller coasters
Understanding the relationship between ride features and popularity
Visualizing trends in roller coaster design over time

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
